â™¨ Crime Exploration









-----




âœ… The problem it mainly focuses on is to do the analysis on the investigation data or the crime records provided by the police station.  

âœ… After analyzing the data, we can see the solution of the analysis in the form of data visualization which gives us more insights.  

âœ… The first feature is the crime mapping which shows the hotspot of the crime by particular type of the crime.  

âœ… Through crime mapping we can explore the regions like which type of crime is more and where, No. of crimes in particular district, etc.  

âœ… The second feature is Crime analysis which works on the predefined questions.

âœ… The crime exploration works on a dynamic model which contains the different types of filteration and slicers to explore the crime hotspot in the particular region.  

Welcome to suraksha-port it is a web app that works on real time dataset. Crime Exploring is our third feature. You can provide a dataset on crime related parameters and it will return a geospatial analysis of the data. Along with that you can tweak the analysis with slicers provided for year, type, district/ward etc.
